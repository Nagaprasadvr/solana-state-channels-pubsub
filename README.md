# Solana P2P Client for State Channels using SVM API

## This is a Solana P2P client for state channels using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) API. It is a simple implementation of a P2P client that can be used to create and manage state channels on the Solana blockchain. The client helps in pushing txs offchain and settling them onchain.
